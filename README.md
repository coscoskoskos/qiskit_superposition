# qiskit_superposition
Various state can be expressed at the same time by creating superposition.

In terms of n bits binary number, we can easily make n states by operating Hadamard to all the qubits.  
What if we want to make n-1 states by n qubits?
That is no so simple, so my goal is to make an algorithm which enables us to make any kinds of superposition.
